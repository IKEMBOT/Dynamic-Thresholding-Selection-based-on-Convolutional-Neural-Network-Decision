# Machine Learning
In this project, we aim to enhance line thresholding using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for optimizing Hue, Saturation, and Lightness (HSL) values. The title of this project is "Enhancing Line Thresholding with CNN and MLP Optimization of HSL Values". this project required to the end of the semester about machine learning class with implemented on the car that will help to define which is lane with automaticly or dymic thresholding in order to robust information for the Autonomous car.

#### Data Collection
For data collection, I utilized the following toolkit made by ownself used simple design to get the parameter but adjust the proper value:

Line thresholding is a critical task in computer vision applications. Our novel approach combines CNNs for feature extraction and MLP for optimizing HSL values. This combination enhances the model's ability to handle variations in lighting and background conditions, leading to more accurate line detection.

### Deep Neural Network Structure
The structure of the Deep Neural Network is as follows:

Our DNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers that learn hierarchical features from input images. The MLP fine-tunes the line thresholding process by optimizing HSL values. This hybrid approach achieves superior results compared to traditional thresholding methods.
